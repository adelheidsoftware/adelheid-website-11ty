Adelheid Software was founded in 2023 by Aaron Yoder in Columbus, Ohio. It is an independent software development studio with a primary focus on games and game-related software.

<br>

We are incredibly passionate about games, technology, and open source. We love creating things and sharing with others, and it is our goal to provide great experiences to everyone.

<br>

Right now, Adelheid Software is just Aaron. However, there is an artist helping out with Posthaste! and we are actively looking for an artist to partner with.
