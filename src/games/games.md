### [Riskrieg](https://riskrieg.com)

**Framework**: Custom Java/Kotlin framework\
**Development Status**: Released\
**Update Status**: On Hiatus\
**Release Date**: 2018<sup>†</sup>

**Riskrieg** is a multiplayer world-domination simulation game. However, it is also much more than that. The Riskrieg community pioneered other uses for it including simulating their own custom worlds using player-built maps, running Dungeons & Dragons simulations, and using it as a tool to run conflict simulations in model diplomacy simulations.

The idea for the game was first conceived in 2011 as a pen-and-paper proof-of-concept and then quickly forgotten. In 2018, the idea was brought back to life in the form of a [Discord bot](https://github.com/Riskrieg/discord-bot). From 2018 through 2022, Riskrieg was updated on a regular basis with a steadily-growing audience. It was open-sourced on April 1, 2021 under the GNU GPLv3 license. However, since the game was open-source and free-to-use, it was difficult to monetize the game, and thus justify continual work on it. In mid-late 2022, Riskrieg development was put on hiatus and left in the hands of the community.

While this game is considered complete, development on Riskrieg is officially **on hiatus**, and development is expected to continue at an undetermined later date. The plan is to always keep Riskrieg free, with our other ventures funding its development into the future, ideally with the help and collaboration of the community.

We know Riskrieg can be so much more than just a game played via a chat bot, but we cannot justify continual development effort with no funding.

<sup>† As our first product, Riskrieg's release predates the founding of Adelheid Software.</sup>
