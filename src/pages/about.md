{{ company.legalName }} is an independent game and software development studio founded in Ohio by Aaron Yoder, effective January 1, 2024.

## Our Story

**{{ company.name }}** started as an idea in 2018, when Aaron was working on [Riskrieg](https://www.riskrieg.com/), a world-domination simulation game designed to be played via Discord. After working on Riskrieg for 3 years and building up a community and a brand, Aaron decided to sit down and work on his dream of creating a game development studio. That idea became {{ company.name }}.

### Our Mission

We believe that games are people-driven and have the power to inspire and connect us in a way not possible in other mediums. That's why we are committed to crafting games that are not only fun and entertaining, but also thought-provoking and deeply impactful. We put all of our effort into creating unforgettable experiences and useful tools, and it is our mission to craft these experiences and tools for you.

### Our Values

At {{ company.name }}, we are guided by the following core values:

We are committed to delivering high-quality games and releasing them when they are ready. We want to respect both our players and our team.
