# Typeface

We use the **[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito)** typeface for our logo.\
For our website text and headings, we are currently using **[Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto)**.

In the full logo, we use **Nunito SemiBold** at a font size of **96 points**.\
In the cropped-in logo, we use **Nunito SemiBold** at a font size of **72 points**.

# Spacing & Corner Radius

The logo should be centered in the image at all times.

We use a corner radius of 24 pixels for our logos.

## Logo
Please do not edit, change, distort, recolor, or reconfigure the Adelheid Software logo.

There are two versions of the logo, and there is also a mark. The logo has a full-size version, and a 75% center crop-in version. Each one has different use-cases. All versions of the logo and the mark can contain a wordmark below, but it is not always required. The wordmark should never be used on its own.

### Full Logo
If you use the full logo, the logo **with the wordmark** is nearly always preferred. When in doubt, **include** the wordmark for this logo.

#### Usage
The full logo should only be used when it is the main element in your design.

You should only exclude the wordmark from the full logo when the context already establishes the brand and makes clear that this is the Adelheid Software logo.

#### Wordmark Placement
The wordmark is always placed below the logo, and is never used alone.

The wordmark is centered horizontally between the left and right edges of the brand container, and centered vertically between the bottom of the brand container and the bottom-most portion of the logo.

### Cropped-in Logo
If you use the cropped-in logo, the logo **without the wordmark** is nearly always preferred. When in doubt, **do not include** the wordmark for this logo.

#### Usage
The cropped-in logo may be used as a main element, but can also be used in other contexts where it would not make sense to use the full logo.

#### Wordmark Placement
The wordmark is always placed below the logo, and is never used alone.

The wordmark is centered horizontally between the left and right edges of the brand container, and centered vertically between the bottom of the brand container and the bottom-most portion of the logo.

### Mark
Use our mark when the brand has already been clearly established on the page or in the design. It is also acceptable to use the mark to link to our website where appropriate.

In some rare contexts, it may be appropriate to use the mark with the wordmark placed below it.
