# Games

### [Riskrieg](https://riskrieg.com)

**Framework**: Custom Java/Kotlin framework\
**Release Date**: 2018

**Riskrieg** is a multiplayer world-domination simulation game created by our founder, Aaron Yoder. However, it is also much more than that. The Riskrieg community pioneered other uses for it including simulating their own custom worlds using player-built maps, running Dungeons & Dragons simulations, and using it as a tool to run conflict simulations in model diplomacy simulations. While Riskrieg is not one of {{ company.name }}'s games, it is important for the history of the company because it led directly to the formation of {{ company.name }}.

The idea for the game was first conceived in 2011 as a pen-and-paper proof-of-concept and then quickly forgotten. In 2018, the idea was brought back to life in the form of a [Discord bot](https://github.com/Riskrieg/discord-bot). From 2018 through 2022, Riskrieg was updated on a regular basis with a steadily-growing audience. It was open-sourced on April 1, 2021 under the GNU GPLv3 license. However, since the game was open-source and free-to-use, it was difficult to monetize the game, and thus difficult to justify continual development. In mid-late 2022, Riskrieg development was put on hiatus and left in the hands of the community, and Aaron began working on the creation of {{ company.name }}.

Note: We do not own Riskrieg, and Riskrieg is the sole property of Aaron Yoder and contributors.
